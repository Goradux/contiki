Contiki implementation for Bosch Sensortec BME680 sensor. 
BME680 is compact and fast and includes temp, RH, and pressure
and gas resistance targeted for indoor air quality. IAQ.

Chip uses I2C or SPI. This implementation and follow Contiki device 
API and I2C.

Example should be generic for most platforms:
examples/avr-rss2/bme680-test

See bme680.h
 
Implemented according to datasheet Rev 1.0. July 2017

Future work:
Mapping between gas resistance and IAQ is need. Also the impact of 
gas heater with respect on T/RH/P. A method for the IAQ use together 
with the meteorological measurements would be nice.
