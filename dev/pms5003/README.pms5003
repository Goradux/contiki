Contiki implementation for Plantower PMS X003 series
dust sensors.

The PMS sensors support serial communication through UART and
I2C. This implementation supports both modes, and they can be
individually turned on/off through config options (PMS_CONF_SERIAL_I2C
and PMS_CONF_SERIAL_I2C). Both can be enabled at the same time,
in which case both will be checked for data.

In UART mode, the operation is asynchronous; the sensor periodically
outputs a frame of data, and the serial-raw UART interface is used for
reading the data.

In I2C mode, the frame is read over I2C from the sensor, triggered by
a timer.

The sensor is duty-cycled through the SET input signal.

This implementation has been tested against the PMS 3003 (UART)
and PMS 5003i (I2C) sensors.
